# hapiauth
An user authentication application developed with HapiJS, NodeJS and MongoDB

### Clone ExpressSite

Clone the ExpressSite repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/methewguda/hapiauth.git
cd ExpressSite
```

If you just want to start a new project without the ExpressSite commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/methewguda/hapiauth.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project:

```
npm install
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`
